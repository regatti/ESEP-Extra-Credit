# ESEP-Extra-Credit

The code for this assignment is in C++.

Instructions:
To run this code, you can use an online C++ compiler: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/.
First, delete the code already in the main.cpp section on the left side of the screen, and replace it with the code in the src.cpp file I have provided (copy (ctrl+c from src.cpp) and paste (ctrl+ v in the main.cpp section on the online compiler website).
Next, click on the "Run" button, and the output will appear on the right side of the screen in the Ouput section.
Your output should look like this: 

"/tmp/CAWhYCJ2BC.o
0
5
6
0
0


=== Code Execution Successful ==="

0,5,6,0,0 are the numbers that should be the output from the src.cpp file.

Modifications to become an official assignemnt:
- require students to comment on their code
- ask students to come up with at least 3 more test/edge/unit cases or provide them with more specific cases to test
- ask students to optimize performance by using more efficient data structures or algorithms or evaluate the time complexity of their functions
- introducing additional methods such as checking if a certain key exists or to delete keys
- grading could consider: functionality, documentation (comments), code quality, error handling, efficiency
